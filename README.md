## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dpuelz/davidsite/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.  This is a test to see if the website will be updated!

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Texas. I study computational statistics and probability modeling for data analysis, and my advisor is [Carlos Carvalho](https://faculty.mccombs.utexas.edu/carlos.carvalho/).

My identical twin is a postdoc in applied math at the University of North Carolina. His website can be found [here](https://cpuelz.github.io/).
