description: Welcome to my website! I am a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Chicago. My research develops probability models and computational methods for applied data analysis. Currently, I work with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/panos-toulis/home">Panos Toulis</a> on randomization methods for causal inference.  Recent work focuses on experimental data generated from networks.  I received my PhD from the University of Texas under the supervision of <a href="https://faculty.mccombs.utexas.edu/carlos.carvalho/">Carlos Carvalho</a>.  <br /><br />  My identical twin is a postdoc in applied math at New York University. His website can be found <a href="https://cpuelz.github.io/">here</a>.  <br /><br /> Here is my <a href="davidpuelzCV_October2019.pdf">CV</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TZGqbWcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Google Scholar</a>.
