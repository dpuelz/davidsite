I am the director of policy analytics for the <a href="https://salemcenter.org">Salem Center for Policy</a> and a clinical assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin.  I am also a visiting principal researcher at the University of Chicago.  My research develops computational methods for applied data analysis, and I apply these methods to problems in business as well as social and behavioral sciences.  Recent work focuses on causal inference and experimental data generated from networks.  <br /><br />My identical twin is an Assistant Professor at Baylor College of Medicine. His website can be found <a href="https://cpuelz.github.io/">here</a>.
